Each curriculum will be presented to a user as a checkbox tree. Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/martinavagyan/StudyProgrammeChecker/tree/master/docs/official%20programs/curriculumn_BS). \r\n\r\n### Student program\r\nThe **student programs** can be downloaded from the the appropriate  ProgRESS WWW page, with .txt extension. After downloading txt's, you can place all the student programs in a regular folder in a computer, and load it to a program.

The status indicates weather the course was inside the student program or not.\r\nRed icon indicates that the student failed to choose the course for the particular study program, and green indicates that the course is inside the study program in the right place. The program also provides suggestions to students.
